# About
This program assists in the creation of convolutional neural network models for image classification. Models are generated with the Keras library, wrapped from Python in C# to allow use between languages. 

# Usage
Load a set of images into the program to be used in classification training. Once the model is built and training is complete, the weights can be saved as a Keras weights file (h5) and be used in either Python or C# (Keras.NET) applications.

# Bugs/Features
Bugs are tracked using the GitHub Issue Tracker.

Please use the issue tracker for the following purpose:
  * To raise a bug request; do include specific details and label it appropriately.
  * To suggest any improvements in existing features.
  * To suggest new features or structures or applications.
